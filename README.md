## Task 1: Definitions of "Package" and "Repository"
# Package

# A package is an archive containing software that may include:
  Executable files
  Libraries
  Configuration files
  Other necessary resources for the program's operation
  
# Packages typically have a specific format, depending on the package manager, e.g.,:
  .deb for Debian/Ubuntu
  .rpm for Red Hat/Fedora
  
# Packages contain metadata describing:
  The program's name and version
  Dependencies
  Other important data

# Repository
  A repository is a centralized storage for packages that:
  Allows users to download and install software
  Can be official (supported by the distribution) or unofficial (created by community or third   parties)
  Provides access to packages, their updates, and dependencies
  
# Package Managers
  # APT (Advanced Package Tool)
    Used in Debian and Ubuntu
    Facilitates easy installation, updating, and removal of packages
   # Key commands:
      apt-get
      apt-cache
      apt

      
# YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)
  Used in Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora
  Supports automatic dependency management
   # Key commands:
    yum install
    yum update
    yum remove
    DNF (Dandified YUM)

# A newer version of YUM with improved performance and functionality
  Key commands:
  dnf install
  dnf update
  dnf remove
  
# Pacman
    Package manager for Arch Linux
    Supports a simple command syntax and dependency management
    Key commands:
    pacman -S
    pacman -R
    pacman -Sy
    
# Zypper
    Package manager for openSUSE
    Manages repositories and dependencies
    
   ### Key commands:
    zypper install
    zypper remove
    zypper update
